1) Copy and paste all the files in the folder code (including input_output folders) and make that folder your working directory.

4) For running all the codes you need to create an environment first and then install the libraries.
Note: for running the code of Q2 which is question2.py, you need to create a custom environment with opencv 3.4.2. in order to use SIFT. 
Install required packages onto your virtual environment. Replace “myenv”with your environment name. 
Enter the following commands in your terminal window. Press ‘y’ when prompted. 
a. conda create -n myenv python=3.7
b. conda activate myenv
c. conda install -c conda-forge opencv=4.1.0
d. conda install -c anaconda numpy
e. conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib
f. conda install -c conda-forge imutils
g. (optional) conda install spyder=4.2.0
h. (optional) spyder
i. pip3 install sympy 



How to run the codes:
After installing all the libraries, we are ready to run the codes. Codes are python script

Note: The code requires the testudo image named as 'test.png' and the tag video named as 'tag.mp4' in the same folder.

Problem  codes are in the file named 'question1.py' for question 1, 'question2.py' for question 2, 'question3.py' for question 3 and 'question4.py' for question 4. Open the file, load your environment.


Sample Commands : python3 q1.py

Note: for running the code of Q3 which is q3.py, you need to create a custom environment with opencv 3.4.2. in order to use SIFT.
